## 👨🏻 Monster Battle 👾  
Make a Monster Battle game, similar to the one [here](https://codepen.io/wostensen/pen/BRRPwz). The game should offer the following features: attack, special attack (an attack with a higher chance of damage), heal, flee, as well as an HP bar for Player and Monster. Attack, special attack and heal are random values and are actions unique to the Player, except for the attack which is also found in Monster, in this case being performed automatically, after the Player performs an action.
